## Introduction

aspgen (A Secure Password GENerator) is an intuitive, easy-to-use,
Python-based program that generates secure passwords securely, i.e.
secures the runtime environment as much as Python allows. In addition
to generating secure passwords, aspgen also analyzes generated and
user-input-ed passwords for "hackability" (entropy and time-to-guess).
This README will start with a detailed description of aspgen's power
and how to harness it followed by a theoretical description of
password security and aspgen's implementations.

## Installation

`pip install aspgen`

## Usage

aspgen aims to be intuitive and simple such that you hopefully won't
even need to read this README (though you still should). The tools
for how to obtain help, generate passwords, analyze passwords, and
store/read reports follow.
